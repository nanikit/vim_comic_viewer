# vim comic viewer

It's comic viewer library which can be used by tampermonkey. Default key binding
is originated from vim's one.

Basic shortcut is

- <kbd>i</kbd>: toggle fullscreen

- <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>↓</kbd>: next page

- <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>↑</kbd>: previous page

- <kbd>;</kbd>: download images

- <kbd>/</kbd>, <kbd>?</kbd>: adjust leading single pages

- <kbd>'</kbd>: stop and reload not completed image

## For developer

Up to date example is [here](https://github.com/nanikit/comic_sources).

Although its version is over 1.0 but it does not mean it is stable. I will
change its major version whenever breaking change happens.
