# vim comic viewer

It's comic viewer library which can be used by tampermonkey. Default key binding
is originated from vim's one.

Basic shortcut is

- i: toggle fullscreen

- j: next page

- k: previous page

- ;: download images

## For developer

Up to date example is [here](https://github.com/nanikit/comic_sources).

Although its version is over 1.0 but it does not mean it is stable. I will
change its major version whenever breaking change happens.
